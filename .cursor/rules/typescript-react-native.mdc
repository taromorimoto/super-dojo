# TypeScript & React Native Conventions

## Code Style Guidelines
- Don't use semicolons
- Use TypeScript for all new code with proper type annotations

## React Native Specific
- Use StyleSheet.create() for component styles

## File Organization
- Components should be in PascalCase (e.g., `HomeScreen.tsx`)
- Utility functions in camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Co-locate tests with components using `__tests__` directories or `.test.tsx` suffix

## Navigation
- Use Expo Router for navigation
- Screens are in `src/screens/` and should end with `Screen.tsx`

## Context & State
- Use React Context for global state
- Prefer hooks for local component state
- Use Convex useQuery and useMutation hooks for backend data
